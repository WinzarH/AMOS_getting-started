# Getting started with SPSS-AMOS

Doctoral Colloquium 1-3 December 2023

## Abstract:

An accessible introduction to Covariance-based Structural Equation Modelling using SPSS-AMOS. This short workshop demonstrates a step-by-step approach, with opportunity for experimentation and discovery. The proposed agenda may be ambitious – we shall move as quickly as the group needs. The focus is on understanding key concepts, methods, and removing the fear factor.

- __Presenter:__ Hume Winzar (Honorary Associate Professor, Macquarie Business School)

- __Time:__ 90 minutes

- __Format:__ demonstration

- __Who should attend:__ HDR candidates and faculty who are unfamiliar with SEM, who want to understand whether SEM is the appropriate analysis tool for their research problems.

- __Prior knowledge:__ Participants should have a sound grasp of basic statistical concepts (t-test, variance, correlation, standard error, statistical significance, etc.)

- __What to bring:__ Nothing. If you have SPSS and AMOS installed on your laptop, then you may be able to follow along as we go.

- __Resources:__ Data and notes are downloadable from the Colloquium website and/or from the presenter’s GitHub repository.
  
  ## Agenda:

- philosophy and theory of SEM
  
  - how SEM differs from traditional Null-Hypothesis Significance Testing
  - underlying assumptions
  - how covariance-based SEM (CB-SEM) differs from partial-least-squares SEM (PLS-SEM)

- Key concepts
  
  - latent variables, manifest variables, error, regression, covariation
  - measurement model and confirmatory factor analysis, 
  - structural model

- The AMOS interface
  
  - constructing a theoretical model
  - accessing data, selecting variables
  - naming variables, naming parameters
  - scaling constraints
  - model parsimony

- Interpreting and reporting results
  
  - goodness of fit
  - unstandardised and standardised coefficients
  - "statistically significant" estimates

- theory-building
  
  - growing and trimming models
  - modification indices
  - alternative model specifications
  
 ### We mention but probably won't have time for:

- stuff that goes wrong
  
  - poor fit
  - Haywood cases (standardised coefficients > 1!?)
  - negative variance
  - failure to converge
  - "covariance matrix is not positive definite"

- Special topics
  
  - moderation (interaction effects)
  - linear growth models
  - time-series
  - multiple groups
  - alternative analysis specifications
